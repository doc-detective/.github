# `docker-image` (alpha)

> This repo is in alpha. It's not ready for production use.

[`docker-image`](https://github.com/doc-detective/docker-image) runs Doc Detective in a container. While Doc Detective can run on most machines as-is, this Docker image simplifies installation and running Doc Detective on machines without Node.js or with heightened security requirements.

This repo depends on [`doc-detective`](doc-detective) for performing the tests.
