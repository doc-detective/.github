# `doc-detective.github.io`

[`doc-detective.github.io`](https://github.com/doc-detective/doc-detective.github.io) are the docs you're reading right now. They're built with Docusaurus and hosted on GitHub Pages.

This repo depends on [`doc-detective-common`](doc-detective-common) for JSON schema definitions to build the references and schema validation logic to power action building experiences.
