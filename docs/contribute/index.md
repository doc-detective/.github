# How to contribute

Doc Detective welcomes contributions of all sorts. If you can't contribute code, you can still help by [reporting issues](#report-issues), suggesting new features, improving the documentation, or [sponsoring](/support) the project.

## Report issues

If you find a bug, report it on the [Doc Detective issue tracker](https://github.com/doc-detective/doc-detective/issues). If you know which [repo](/docs/category/repos) the bug appears in, open it in that project's specific tracker.

Make sure to include as much information as possible, such as the version of Doc Detective you're using, the operating system you're on, and any error messages you see.

## Contribute code or docs

> Before any code or doc contributions are accepted, you need to sign the [contributor license agreement](https://cla-assistant.io/doc-detective/doc-detective.github.io) (CLA). This agreement makes sure that your contributions are properly licensed and maintains the project's open-source status and ongoing health.

1. Fork the [repo](/docs/category/repos) you want to contribute to.
2. Create a new branch.
3. Make your changes.
4. Submit a pull request to the project or `rc` (release candidate) branch.
5. Wait for your pull request to be reviewed. All discussions regarding the pull request will be conducted on GitHub.
6. Make any necessary changes to your pull request.
7. Your pull request will be merged if it is reviewed and approved.
