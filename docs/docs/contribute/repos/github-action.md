# `github-action`

[`github-action`](https://github.com/doc-detective/github-action) runs Doc Detective in GitHub workflows. While Doc Detective can run in any CI/CD environment, this GitHub Action simplifies the process of running Doc Detective in GitHub workflows, provides a `results` object that can be used in subsequent steps, and offers handy features like creating GitHub issues for failed tests.

This repo depends on [`doc-detective`](doc-detective) for performing the tests.
